ResponsibleApps
===============

Example apps, code and libraries for apps responsible for battery, connectivity and data usage.

Currently this is just a few simple modifications to some small sample apps for WP8 and Android.

At this point we are just showing simple mods to handle connectivity.  Soon we will abstract that out to cross-platform, reusable libraries as appropriate.


Currently the simple examples leverage [Akavache](https://github.com/github/Akavache) and Xamarin/Mono for cross platform C#.

Akavache provides for caching and the underlying store for our store forward work and thankfully provides a consistent API accross Win8/WinPhone8/MonoDroid/MonoTouch.
